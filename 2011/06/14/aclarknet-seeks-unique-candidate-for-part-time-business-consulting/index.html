<p>tags: <a href="../../../../tag/plone.html">Plone</a></p></footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We are looking for a unique and talented (but mostly non-technical)
individual that is passionate about Plone, and able to dedicate some
small amount of time per month to generating new business for us[1].</p>
<p>Plone is up and coming (again)! And we want to (1.) capitalize on that
fact and (2.) scale our business accordingly. But to do so, we really
need your help.</p>
<div class="section" id="about-us">
<h2>About us</h2>
<p>We are a team[2] of Python, Plone, Web, and Business savvy people
focused on Python, Plone, the web, and generally speaking: deploying and
maintaining Plone applications that range from CMS to specialized
applications, tailored to fit the needs of our clients[3].</p>
<div class="section" id="alex">
<h3>Alex</h3>
<p>For those of you that know me, you know that I am largely technically,
very artistic, and focused a lot on systems and making-things-work (vs.
programming), and that I am passionate to a fault about Plone and the
Plone community. For those of you that don't know me, I'm responsible
for all new business at ACLARK.NET and I am the technical lead on all of
our projects. I also rock a maroon Japanese Fender Stratocaster (circa
mid 1980s) on occasion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="amy">
<h3>Amy</h3>
<p>My wife and business partner Amy is the &quot;business coordinator&quot; and she
handles all things customer-related (that are non-technical) as well as
anything legal and/or financial. If you know her, then you know she is a
force to be reckoned with as well as one of the nicest, most
professional people you will ever meet. If you don't know her, watch
out! When she is not watching the bottom line, Amy can be found caring
for our always-singing-while-she-is-on-the-phone yellow canary: J.
Alexander Chirpington III.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="team">
<h3>Team</h3>
<p>Team ACLARK also consists of a variety of highly skilled sub contractors
that always make us look good by making our clients happy, and hopefully
have lots of fun doing it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="business">
<h3>Business</h3>
<p>To date, other than constantly &quot;pimping&quot; (promoting) myself personally
(on behalf of my company) within the Plone community, we have never
actively sought out any business. And we manage to stay quite busy with
the work that finds us. But it has occurred to us that in order to
compete most effectively with &quot;the big boys&quot; (i.e. all our
friends/colleagues/etc at <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.net">http://plone.net</a>) we need to be more
pro-active about seeking out new business.</p>
<p>That's where you come in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-you">
<h2>About you</h2>
<p>We need someone to pursue leads on our behalf, because we simply don't
have time to do it and we don't have anyone in-house that is
particularly well-suited to the task. However, we don't want to let that
stop us from growing our business and deploying as many Plone sites as
possible; especially when we are confident we have the ability to
deliver on just about any kind of Plone-related project, and then some
(i.e. Django, Pyramid, etc., almost anything Python-related.)</p>
<div class="section" id="criteria">
<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>First and foremost, you love (and use) Plone (but aren't necessarily an
integrator/developer; most likely an end user). But also:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You are a &quot;people person&quot;.</li>
<li>You have some writing skills, perhaps even a technical writer.</li>
<li>You are aggressive about scoring new business, perhaps even someone
with a sales background.</li>
<li>You are a professional, and will represent us and our business
accordingly!</li>
</ul>
<p>Also nice to have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You have a full-time job that is Plone-related.</li>
<li>You have experience writing proposals.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't necessarily have to &quot;know everything&quot; to do this job
effectively for us, but you do have to be excited and pro-active about
it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logistics">
<h3>Logistics</h3>
<p>We don't know how this will work yet. We are certainly willing to pay a
percentage of the anticipated bid value for any bid we win, but we are
considering other options as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next-step">
<h3>Next step</h3>
<p>Sound like you? Let's talk: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:aclark&#64;aclark.net">aclark&#64;aclark.net</a>, 301-312-5236.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you, and please feel free to pass this
information on to anyone you think may be interested in this
opportunity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notes">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Finding and submitting proposals, with our assistance, as needed.
Even something as small as 8 hours per month would be helpful.</li>
