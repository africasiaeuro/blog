<p>First: I liked it. Second: I appreciate Aspeli writing it. Third: Like many others, I couldn't wait for it to come out. Fourth: I know that it was a <strong>TON OF WORK</strong> and <strong>PROBABLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY</strong> to write it. So why write a Plone book? A few reasons (other than money):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It's good for you</li>
<li>It's good for the community</li>
<li>It's good for Plone</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you care about Plone: please go buy both an electronic and paper version of this book <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[0]</a>. While you are at it, please pick up a copy of <strong>Plone 3.3 Site Administration</strong>. It's quite good, and I hear the author is a <strong>swell guy</strong> who would appreciate your generosity <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[1]</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3">[2]</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-i-like">
<h2>What I like</h2>
<p>First let me cover what I <strong>ABSOLUTELY LOVE</strong> about this book.</p>
<div class="section" id="buildout-eggs">
<h3>buildout:eggs</h3>
<img alt="images/buildout.png" src="images/buildout.png" />
<p>Aspeli correctly addresses one of my biggest pet peeves (concerns) about what I believe to be an <strong>ANTI-PATTERN</strong> in almost every Plone buildout: buildout:eggs (referring to the eggs parameter of the buildout section; it does not exist, other than as a convenient variable setting).</p>
<p>If you know me, you know I've spoken about this before and whilst I've moved on from harping on it I will say this: with most software that uses ini-style configuration files when you set a parameter you expect something to happen. But since Buildout is more complicated than the average software that uses ini-style configuration, that expectation is not always met.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-ons">
<h3>Add-ons</h3>
<img alt="images/addons.png" src="images/addons.png" />
<p>Did you see? You might have missed it. No mention of <strong>Products</strong> WHAT-SO-EVER. &quot;Product&quot; was a term that Zope2 used for Python libraries that enhanced the functionality of Zope2, and it stuck. Now, it should die in favor of a term everyone else in the world is familiar with (in this context): add-on. Well played, Aspeli. Well played.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-review">
<h2>The Review</h2>
<p>I will now talk about each chapter briefly. This will be TL;DR-style, but I hope you'll get a nice idea for why this book is so great. Every imaginable detail for each section is covered in the book in painstaking detail by Aspeli. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask them in the comments.</p>
<div class="section" id="chapter-1-plone-in-context">
<h3>Chapter 1: Plone in Context</h3>
<p>In which we learn what, why &amp; when Plone is, plus a bit more. My favorite sub-section is: Plone-the-application and Plone-the-framework, in which Aspeli describes the phenomenon of Plone the application being used by some folks as a generic Python web framework. Plone's strengh and indeed its raison d'etre (reason to exist) is to provide a fully-featured CMS web application suitable for immediate use, or use immediately after a few simple customizations. So if you try to use it as a web framework, you may not get exactly what you expect (because it was not designed to be used that way).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-2-introduction-to-the-case-study">
<h3>Chapter 2: Introduction to the Case Study</h3>
<p>In which we learn how a professional may execute a typical website project with Plone. This is a nice little chapter with some great details about the fictional project that will be executed throughout the remainder of the book: requirements, mockups, and information architecture are the highlights here; as well as the necessary CMS details like users, groups, and content types.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-3-the-development-environment">
<h3>Chapter 3: The Development Environment</h3>
<p>In which we learn about how to setup an environment in which you can customize Plone to suit your needs. TL;DR: fairly typical Python development environment <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4">[3]</a> with additional Plone details covered: Buildout recipes, development libraries, and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-4-basics-of-customization">
<h3>Chapter 4: Basics of Customization</h3>
<p>In which we learn about the technical architecture of Plone: ZODB, GenericSetup, Zope2 CMF, Zope Component Architecture, and more (!). And the best way to implement your requirements within that architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-5-developing-a-site-strategy">
<h3>Chapter 5: Developing a Site Strategy</h3>
<p>In which we learn about how to bundle your customizations into a Python package for general use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-6-security-and-workflow">
<h3>Chapter 6: Security and Workflow</h3>
<p>In which we learn about how Plone implements generic web application features and how you can customize that implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-7-using-add-ons">
<h3>Chapter 7: Using Add-ons</h3>
<p>In which we learn about how to add additional Python libraries to Plone to provide additional features.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-8-creating-a-custom-theme">
<h3>Chapter 8: Creating a Custom Theme</h3>
<p>In which we learn about Plone's new theming engine: Diazo.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-9-nine-core-concepts-of-zope-programming">
<h3>Chapter 9: Nine Core Concepts of Zope Programming</h3>
<p>In which learn a bit more about the technical architecture of Plone. If you love this chapter (as many do), you might also enjoy: <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.plone.org/reference_manuals/old/zope_secrets/index.html">http://developer.plone.org/reference_manuals/old/zope_secrets/index.html</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-10-custom-content-types">
<h3>Chapter 10: Custom Content Types</h3>
<p>In which we learn about Plone's new content type framework: Dexterity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-11-standalone-views-and-forms">
<h3>Chapter 11: Standalone Views and Forms</h3>
<p>In which we learn about a topic that would be first, if Plone were a generic website framework: how to build forms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-12-relational-databases">
<h3>Chapter 12: Relational Databases</h3>
<p>In which we learn about how to integrate a relational database into your CMS application. Since Plone relies heavily on the ZODB, none is included by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-13-users-and-their-permissions">
<h3>Chapter 13: Users and their Permissions</h3>
<p>In which we learn about another topic that would be covered first if Plone were a generic website framework: authentication and authorization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-14-dynamic-user-interfaces-with-jquery">
<h3>Chapter 14: Dynamic User Interfaces with jQuery</h3>
<p>In which we learn about using jQuery in Plone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-15-summary-and-potential-enhancements">
<h3>Chapter 15: Summary and Potential Enhancements</h3>
<p>In which we learn about next steps. You've just built and delivered a CMS application for your client. What will they ask you for next? And how will you implement it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">

But according to my statements, I still need to earn about $1K more in royalties before I have paid back my advance. Notice what I just said there: <strong>earn in royalties</strong> i.e. I have to sell enough books in order to get PACKT to pay out enough money to meet the terms of the contract. I won't pretend to have any idea why PACKT does what it does with its contracts, except to say that I assume they expect to make money. I'll also assume everything is on the up and up. But unfortunately sometimes the &quot;up and up&quot; can look like this: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121018/01054720744/hollywood-accounting-how-19-million-movie-makes-150-million-still-isnt-profitable.shtml">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121018/01054720744/hollywood-accounting-how-19-million-movie-makes-150-million-still-isnt-profitable.shtml</a>.</td></tr>
