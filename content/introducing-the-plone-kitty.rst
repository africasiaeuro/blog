*Actually: re-introducing the Plone Kitty from Plone 1!*

*Plone Kitty* is the name of a theme (then called "skin") that shipped with the earliest versions of `Plone <http://plone.org>`_ (1.1 in the image above). This was a simpler time when the web was new, and everything was possible!

Today, we know that the **web is hard**. While everything is still possible, building the web requires a tremendous amount of hard work. But it doesn't have to be all drudgery. There is still quite a bit of fun to be had building the web, if you know where to look (in addition to all the unavoidable hard work).

Enter: Plone. Both the web and Plone have changed drastically since The Plone Kitty once prowled the internet. And while the Plone Kitty is all but extinct, Plone lives on; continously modernizing itself to keep up with the fast pace of today's modern web.

    If you used Plone "back in the day" (early 2000s), please add a comment below about your experiences then. If you are new to Plone or just curious about it now, please add a comment below about your initial impressions.

So if you'd like to add **your bit of nostalgia**, or first impressions of Plone, `please do so here <http://plone-1-fun.herokuapp.com/#disqus>`_. I appreciate any and all comments.
