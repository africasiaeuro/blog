`Pillow 2.1.0 is out! <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.1.0>`_ With this release, the Pillow team has *finally* removed support for "import _imaging", thus completing the move of PIL modules into the PIL namespace [1]_. Many thanks to Eric Soroos (AKA wiredfool) who completed the majority of this work. Also a big thanks to Christopher Gohlke and `Arfrever <https://github.com/Arfrever>`_ both of whom rallied around a push to get the 2.1.0 release out on schedule. And I want to thank everyone else who reported an issue and/or sent a pull request to help make this release the best it could be.

Quarterly release cycle
-----------------------

After the March 15, 2013 release of Pillow 2.0.0 we decided to adopt a quarterly release cycle. So every three months, as long as the patches keep coming you will see a new Pillow release.

Look ma no official funding
---------------------------

Pillow 2.0.0 was an enormous effort, made possible by a generous grant from the Python Software Foundation. But things have stablized quite a bit since then. So much so, that with help from many others I was able to squeeze this release into my normal schedule. However you are always welcome to financially help support Pillow, especially if you are using it in a commercial environment. Committers are encouraged to add their name here if they'd like to receive donations:

And I have personally steered my gittip profile entirely towards Pillow production.
