*The 3 in 2013 is for Python 3*

I tend to like projects that everyone else **hates**, e.g.:

- Removing persistent Python objects associated with missing classes in ZODB.
- Making new releases for old software that is still useful but unmaintained.
- Running flake8 on 10s or 100s of source files and hand-fixing the results.

Part of this has to do with **repetition**. I know how to do these things, and I like doing them. Over and over. If someone says, "my Data.fs file is broken" I get excited. Anyway, I hope you get the idea.

I am your man

Which brings me to the subject of this post: **Python 3 Porting**. I've been helping out porting the Python Imaging Library to Python 3 (via the Pillow fork, where I am the release manager). And it strikes me as the type of thing I'd be very interested in doing professionally. So, if you or your company are in need of a "workhorse" to plow through old code and update it, `I am your man <http://aclark.net/team/alex-clark>`_. Please do `get in touch <mailto:info@aclark.net>`_.

What's in it for you
--------------------

Now I know what you are thinking: **porting Python 2 software to Python 3 is a lot of work for little gain**. Maybe. Maybe not. I'm not going to try to convince you otherwise, however I will tell you this:

- For me, 2013 is "the year of Python 3". I've now promised to deliver and maintain a **Python 3 compatible PIL by PyCon 2013**. I now care about Python 3 (this was not true before).
- The Python 3 Wall of Shame is now the `Python 3 Wall of Superpowers <https://python3wos.appspot.com/>`_. We are over the hump.
- Many popular Python web frameworks support or are about to support Python 3 e.g. CherryPy, Django, Pyramid.

So, there is no time like the present to **take a serious look at Python 3**.
