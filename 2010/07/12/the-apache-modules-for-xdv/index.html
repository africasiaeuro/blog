<p>tags: <a href="../../../../tag/plone.html">Plone</a></p></footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I was recently tasked with consolidating our various <strong>business services</strong> (website, software repository, mailing lists, ldap, etc.) on to a single virtual machine (ostensibly to save money, although it didn't quite work out that way). The Apache modules for XDV presented themselves as an attractive technique to use, in helping me achieve my goals.</p>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Previously, I had been blissfully running <a class="reference external" href="http://aclark.net">http://aclark.net</a> with NGINX, Plone 4 trunk, and XDV on a small virtual machine and absolutely loving it.</p>
<p>Additionally, I had separate virtual machines for my Wordpress blog (blog.aclark.net) and Subversion software repository (svn.aclark.net).  The isolation of these services made them easy to manage and still relatively cheap to run them all.</p>
<p>And in fact, I have come to rely heavily on the ability to (1.) rapidly create a virtual machine, (2.) install a bunch of vendor packages that Just Work™, and (3.) build out whatever was left i.e. whatever could not be easily installed via OS vendor packages. This usually translates loosely into &quot;I use Buildout for my Plone sites, and an OS vendor package installer for everything else&quot;.</p>
<p>That said, even though I already knew the hazards of trying to cram too many services on to a single &quot;shared&quot; host, and didn't really want to do that dance again, it seemed reasonable at the time to at least try and consolidate them on to a single virtual machine (it sounds crazy in hindsight).</p>
<div class="section" id="first-choice-nginx">
<h3>First choice: NGINX</h3>
<p>Like I said earlier, the forked version of NGINX available on the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/html-xslt/">HTML-XSLT website</a> is an absolute pleasure to use. But when I pondered consolidating services I knew it would not be easy, and maybe even impossible to run Wordpress behind NGINX.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="second-choice-apache">
<h3>Second choice: Apache</h3>
<p>So I thought to myself, &quot;I know, I'll just switch to the Apache modules for XDV&quot; and that will solve my PHP/Plone &quot;integration&quot; problems for the time being. (Another way to solve them would be to use the <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dv.xdvserver">XDV middleware</a> along with <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Zope2/2.13.0a1">Zope 2.13</a>'s WSGI support; I will be trying that next.)</p>
<p>But not so fast.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="problems">
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>Of course, things don't always go as planned.</p>
<div class="section" id="first-problem">
<h3>First problem</h3>
<p>The Apache modules for XDV do not work exactly &quot;as advertised&quot; on any of the &quot;modern&quot; OS platforms I tried (Debian, various Ubuntus, and Arch Linux). They compile fine against the operating system's Apache, but do not run properly. See <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coactivate.org/projects/deliverance/lists/deliverance-discussion/archive/2010/06/1276982495896/forum_view">this thread</a> on the Deliverance mailing list (and I challenge anyone reading this to correct me! :-D)</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; I thought, I'll just create a buildout to deploy everything. I <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.aclark.net/2010/03/30/blood-sweat-tears-and-a-new-plone-book/">wrote a book</a> about deploying Plone websites with Buildout. This should be easy, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="second-problem">
<h3>Second problem</h3>
<p>It's hard to create such a buildout for a variety of reasons, but most noticeably in my mind is the &quot;library soup&quot; you may encounter on any modern system. For example, I started off by trying to include all the dependencies in the buildout. But I ended up leaving things out, like libxml2 and libxslt relying instead on the operating system vendor packages. Because even though I tried desperately to tell every other dependency about the included libxml2 and libxslt2, I still ended up with an annoying &quot;missing symbols&quot; error at the end (meaning I likely missed a compiler flag along the way).</p>
<p>These errors can be very frustrating, and even worse: <strong>sporadic</strong>.  Sometimes you may inadvertently add or remove a system dependency during the build process. So you could be relying on a system package and not even know it until later when it is too late (i.e. when you are enjoying some unplanned and unexpected down time).</p>
<p>So there I went again. It took several days I didn't really have, and the results were not what I expected, but I'm still somewhat happy with them. Now, I want to share this buildout particularly with folks considering using the Apache modules for XDV (<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/html-xslt/">http://code.google.com/p/html-xslt/</a>). Because while it would be much easier if the Apache modules Just Worked™ with OS vendor packages, in the event that they don't (which is what I experienced) folks may find this buildout helpful. (That, and Jon Stahl requested it on Facebook :-D).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Anyway, I'm quite happy with the buildout and I am sharing it in hopes that it will move the Apache/XDV story forward.</p>
<p>In addition to compiling Apache with mod_depends and mod_transform, it includes Subversion, Trac, mod_wsgi, PHP and Wordpress. As I mentioned earlier, it is not really my preference to cram all this stuff in to one buildout, but as long as it is reliable and consistent, I don't mind it too much. It also handles the theme compilation for a variety of services, which is accomplished via a command recipe that executes calls to <em>bin/xdvcompiler</em>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I have no particular allegiance to, or dislike of Apache: more like a love/hate relationship; it can be very useful in a variety of situations, while at the same time confounding. But regardless, I would like to see the Apache XDV modules be able to deliver the same rock solid performance as the NGINX fork.</p>
<p>Kudos to Laurence Rowe (et al.) for the Apache modules! I hope this blog entry will facilitate a push to get people using them with their <em>operating system vendor's Apache packages</em>, which may inspire Laurence to continue developing them, and most importantly to fix bugs ;-).</p>
<p>Normally, I like to factor out the reusable bits first, but this buildout is presented in it's entirety as I am using it (minus some customer bits), for whatever that is worth. Here is a look at the &quot;main&quot; buildout.cfg file, most of which should be self-explanatory. Click around this site to see the results:</p>
